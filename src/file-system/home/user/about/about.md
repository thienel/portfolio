# Hi there

My name is Le Hung Thien, and I’m currently a third-year student at FPT University. I'm a backend developer with astrong focus on Golang. In addition, I have hands-on
experience with C# and ReactJS.

I’m passionate about building things that are simple on
the outside, but powerful under the hood — just like
Golang, which is why it’s my language of choice.

Fun fact: I used to be a city-level athlete in 10m air
pistol shooting, where I earned several notable
achievements — a journey that taught me discipline,
focus, and patience.

If you’d like to explore more about my projects
(including this website), type "cd ~/projects"
then "ls" to see details. Enjoy!
