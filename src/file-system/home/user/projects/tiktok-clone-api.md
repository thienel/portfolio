## *Tiktok Clone API*

### • C#, SQL Server, JWT, Entity Framework, Identity

This is a simulated backend API built to support my
tiktok-clone-ui frontend project. The key takeaway from
this project was learning how to structure code
effectively using Clean Architecture principles. I also
implemented all JWT-related features — a significant
challenge for me at the time.
