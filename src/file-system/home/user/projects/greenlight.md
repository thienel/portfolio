## *Greenlight (REST API)*

### • Golang, PostgreSQL

This project was built while following Let’s Go Further
by Alex Edwards, which significantly deepened my
understanding of Go backend development. It’s a movie
database management system featuring full CRUD
operations, token-based authentication, and
permission-based access control (PBAC). The project was
developed entirely through the command-line interface,
helping me grasp real-world workflows and
production-ready patterns.
