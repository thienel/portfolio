## *Snippetbox (Web Application)*

### • Golang, MySQL

This was the first project where I used Golang, developedalongside the book Let’s Go by Alex Edwards. It was
through this project that I discovered how enjoyable Go
can be. The application itself is a snippet management
tool with expiration support and user login based on
session authentication. The book covers nearly everythingyou need to learn and start using the language
effectively. While the project doesn’t dive into highly
advanced techniques, it gave me a solid and practical
foundation to build upon.
