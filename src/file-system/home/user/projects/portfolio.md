### • React, TypeScript, Vite, GSAP, WebGL

This is a self-built project created to recreate UI effects that I found interesting. The simulation component, which you are seeing here, was inspired by Edward Hinrichsen and references his source code.
It was also my first time working with WebGL, TypeScript, and GSAP — which initially made the development process challenging. Tackling those hurdles deepened my understanding of browser graphics, animation, and type-safe coding.
