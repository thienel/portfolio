### • React, TypeScript, Vite, GSAP, WebGL

This self-initiated project was built to recreate UI
effects that I found compelling. The simulation
component you see here was inspired by Edward Hinrichsen and draws upon his source code.
It also marked my first experience working with WebGL,
TypeScript, and GSAP — technologies that initially made
the development process quite challenging. Overcoming
these hurdles significantly deepened my understanding
of browser-based graphics and animation.
