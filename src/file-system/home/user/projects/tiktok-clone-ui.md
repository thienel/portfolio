## *Tiktok Clone UI*

### • ReactJS, SCSS, Axios

This was the first project where I worked with ReactJS.
The most challenging part was organizing components — I
spent most of my time figuring out how to split and
structure them in a clean and maintainable way.
Integrating the frontend with the backend API also gave
me a clearer understanding of how everything connects andworks together. Working with plain JavaScript made
refactoring quite difficult, which later motivated me to build my portfolio site using TypeScript instead.
